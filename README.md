# React + TypeScript + Vite - Shopping Cart 

# Descritpion
In the past 7 months I have diving on ReactJs. Learning React opened the horizons of web development in accordance of performance and fastness.
I wanted to build a project which would allows me to level up my skills in React. For this reason I built a shopping cart with the tutorial on YouTube by Dave Gray. The tutorial covers one of the most important hooks of react. I learned useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer and useMemo. The tutorial was also remarkable because Dave teaches how to use Typescript on ReactJs which is on of the best choices.
